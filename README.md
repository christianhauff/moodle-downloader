# Moodle Downloader

fork from davidgengenbach/moodle-downloader
Didn't work on Moodle Instance of HS-Pforzheim, due to differences in the html-structure
Haven't used/fixed the web version, only python

This script is used to download (HS Pforzheim) Moodle Assets automatically.

There is a web-version you can execute inside the web browser (see `README.md` in the folder). You have to be logged-in for this version.

There is also a more comfortable version where you just have to execute a python script.
